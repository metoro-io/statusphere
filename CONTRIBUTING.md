## Getting Started

Before you write a PR, please an open an issue to discuss the changes you'd like to make. This will help us understand what you're trying to achieve and make sure that we're on the same page and that your work will be accepted.

This doesn't need to be an essay, just a short description of what you're trying to achieve and why then we'll quickly flesh out the details together.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
3. Make your changes
4. Open the PR and link the issue that you opened in the previous step
